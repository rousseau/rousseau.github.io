Studies about brain maturation aim at providing a better understanding of brain developmentand links between brain changes and cognitive development. Such studies are of great interestfor diagnosis help and clinical course of development and treatment of illnesses. Several teams have begun to make 3D maps of developing brain structures from children to young adults. However, working out the development of fetal and neonatal brain remains an openissue. 

In this context, Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is a fundamental tool to study structuralbrain development across age group. In this project, we have developed new image processing tools combining morphological information provided by T2-weighted MR images and diffusion information (degree of myelination and fibre orientation) given by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The joint analysis of these anatomical features stress the generic maturation of normal fetal brain.
